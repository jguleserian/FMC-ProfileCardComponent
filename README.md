## Overview

This is a simple profile card component just like one you may see in social media. Its design is simple and fairly straight forward. 

The reason I chose this challenge was to practice a new system of CSS organization: GPS. It is organized according to:
- Global settings
- Page settings
- Section settings

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

This project was created utilizing my established workflow. However, as I am practicing a new stylesheet organization, see below for a reference to the parameters as defined by Jeff Escalante.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- GPS

### What I learned

While this was a simple project, I ended up spending quite a bit of time trying to get the background elements placed according to the model utilizing something systematic. In the end, I opted for just placing them manually.

### Continued development

Next steps:
1. Move on to the "Junior"level of Frontend Mentor. I have stayed inthe "Newbie"category for quite a while trying to get a lot of quick practice and develop a workflow. I feel like I am comfortable with this process and have met my goals. I'm sure I will see the increase in difficulty on my next project.
2. Take GPS to the next level.
3. Take on more JavaScript projects, and perhaps some with Node.js.

### Useful resources

- [Jeff Escalante's GPS System for organizing CSS](https://github.com/jescalan/gps) - This system made more sense to me, in terms of effeciency of code than the ever-popular BEM system.
